                        <p>When you order from Feeling Wood, you are ordering directly from the manufacturer. This means
                            we don’t answer to anyone but you. Our only goal is that you have a good experience and your
                            space turns out exactly as you envisioned.
                        </p>

                        <h3><strong>Return & Exchange Policy*</strong></h3>
                        <p>Return or exchange requests must be made within 30 days of receiving your Feeling Wood. It
                            must be unused and returned in full (not cut and with the peel and stick backer intact—it's
                            ok if one of the boxes was opened, but must be resealed). If you have an unopened, unused
                            left-over box, let us know and you can return it for a partial refund.

                        </p>

                        <p> ● If you’re exchanging for a higher-priced product, you will be responsible for covering the
                            price difference.
                        </p>

                        <p> ● For returns, you'll be asked to pay the shipping fees and a 15% restocking fee.</p>

                        <p> ● Custom orders cannot be returned or exchanged.</p>

                        <p> ● Tools, trim and accessories are not returnable.</p>
