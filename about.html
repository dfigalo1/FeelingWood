                Our history</strong></h2>
            <br>
            <p>We are hard core working people with more than four decades of experience in the industry.

                We grew up looking at how cabinetmakers by trade shaped wood as if it were a work of art, building eternal wooden furniture and decorative pieces that are still today a living testimony of the past.</p>
     <p>Inspired by their craft and work (moulding the raw materials, creating a design, crafting the piece), we developed our very own recipe to keep the trade alive with a contemporary twist: we combine high technology and innovations with artisanal work and craftsmanship, through a careful and delicate worldwide wood selection process.</p>
        <p>They all come from implanted forests or have been removed by sustainable forest maintenance procedures (considering energy optimization and the best utilization of the raw materials).</p>
    <p>We are deeply committed to the creation of unique spaces, so that they are warm, sustainable and also eternalâ€¦ just like those cabinetmaker's pieces that initiated us in the fascinating world of exotic woods.</p>
